## 🚧 In Progress / Planned: UI & UX Revamp (v1.2)

Source of truth: `specs/UI_IMPROVEMENTS.md`

### Scope
- Header redesign: title (reset), centered search, right‑side actions (Sort ▾, Favorites‑only, Import/Export, Settings)
- Card redesign: collapsed scan view → expandable timestamps
- Timestamps: inline actions (Open, Copy URL, Copy MD), inline edit, Undo delete
- Keyboard‑first: '/', Enter, Arrow keys, 't', '?', Esc; visible focus
- Tags model: chips + token input with autocomplete; optional AND/OR advanced mode later
- Toasts & states: aria‑live toasts; empty states; first‑run tips
- A11y: list/listitem roles; aria‑pressed for favorites, aria‑expanded for groups; focus management
- Performance: windowed list; 120 ms debounce; diacritic‑insensitive search; precomputed lowercase fields

### Acceptance Criteria (v1.2)
- Popup interactive in < 300 ms with ~1k items (virtualized)
- 100% functionality via keyboard with visible focus
- Undo for destructive actions; no dead‑ends
- Dark/light themes with WCAG AA; respects reduced motion
- No horizontal scroll; graceful truncation

### Risks & Mitigations (v1.2)
- Keyboard model complexity → centralize shortcut map; add cheatsheet modal
- Virtualization edge cases with dynamic heights → measure or fixed row height per timestamp row; overscan tuning

### Release Plan (v1.2)
- Alpha behind feature flag in popup
- Beta build for manual testing (Chrome, Brave; high‑contrast mode)
- Docs update (README screenshots; keyboard shortcuts)
- Store release notes and version bump to 1.2.x
